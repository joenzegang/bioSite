        <p>
My name is Charli Massicka I was born and raised in Bangui (Central African Republic). I developed an early interest in Engineering and Languages while living in different countries. Having a background in different cultures of different countries, I have a curious mind and interest in international cultures. I received my Bachelors Degree in Aerospace Engineering in China as an honor graduate student then I moved to America in 2016.

        <p>
            When I was in high school and college, I participated in sports such as: soccer, volleyball, basketball, track and high jump. Being part of the leadership in many student organizations provided me the opportunity to contribute to many transactions, including building new restrooms for students, purchase of chairs and tables for the school through a system of fund raising that I created. I also enjoy camping, going to church and spending time with my family.
