        <p>
            When I was in high school and college, I participated in sports such as: soccer, volleyball, basketball, track and high jump. Being part of the leadership in many student organizations provided me the opportunity to contribute to many transactions, including building new restrooms for students, purchase of chairs and tables for the school through a system of fund raising that I created. I also enjoy camping, going to church and spending time with my family.
